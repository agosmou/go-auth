# Go Auth

Based on the jetBrains [article](https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/go/tutorials/authentication-for-go-apps/auth/)

Note:
- specify the "localhost:8080" host in the .Run(), otherwise youll have to deal with the windows firewall notification every time you run the app since it will be running on 0.0.0.0:8080
